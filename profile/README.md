# Bolt OSS

This organization was created with the goal of providing support for Bolt CMS until 2029.

However, the Bolt community is starting to organize itself and Bolt version [*5.2.0 has been released*](https://github.com/bolt/core/releases/tag/5.2.0).

Not wanting to duplicate work and not wanting to divide the community already weakened by the loss of Bob, discussions are underway to integrate the changes made to Bolt OSS into the original Bolt CMS.
